Our company's mission is to create a billion magical moments. I am the Director of Customer Happiness, which means I'm responsible for being the voice of Lovepop to our customers. And then also being the voice of our customers within Lovepop.\n\nSo it goes in both directions. So before our transition to Agorapulse, one of the things that was really difficult for us was that we had a high volume of ads where customers were commenting and wanted to interact with us or wanted to tell us what they thought of the products or advertising. And we had a limited number of licenses for our social media monitoring tool. And so we were unable to keep up with the inbox and the inbox was actually unable to keep up with the volume of ads we were running.\n\nAnd so we both weren't getting all the comments that were being added to all these ads and we couldn't reply to what we were getting anyway. So when we moved over to Agorapulse, we got to the point where we had an inbox that captured direct messages. It captured the listening and we were able to pull in the ad comments in the same place we could use it, just like we would use any other inbox, like in our ticketing system. It's really changed our ability to follow up with customers and make sure we're being responsive and interacting with them when they want.\n\nAlso, a little hidden feature that I love is that you can see the history of any customer's comments with us. So sometimes we'll get a comment and we're not exactly sure whether they were talking to us earlier or if this is somebody who has been giving us a hard time for a while. And you can just click on them and see their profile and get an idea for how they've interacted with us over time."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"1e71e7","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"language":"","onByDefault":"false","on":"true","async":"false"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"1e71e7","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"language":"","onByDefault":"false","on":"true","async":"false"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}}
