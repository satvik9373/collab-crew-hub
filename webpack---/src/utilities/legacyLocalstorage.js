/*
 * DEPRECATED: Use utilities/wistiaLocalStorage.js directly instead.
 *
 * This module has two failings.
 *
 * First, it must include utilities/obj for its deep setting and getting
 * functionality, which is a core part of its API. However, this convenience
 * does not merit the size of its inclusion; if we want to do deep setting and
 * getting, we can just compose with Obj.setDeep and Obj.getDeep at the import site.
 *
 * Second, in order to avoid lots of JSON.parse calls, it keeps a cache that
 * should mirror the contents of localStorage. However, because localStorage
 * data is shared across tabs with the same domain--and because we are never
 * syncing the actual localStorage values here--changes in multiple open tabs
 * will overwrite each other, causing general strangeness.
